A server for parsing and evaluating dice notation.

## Usage

* Stable version: https://dice-server-js.herokuapp.com
* Latest development version: https://dice-server-js-staging.herokuapp.com

DSJS provides a basic client for evaluating standard dice notation.  Instructions for using this client, as well as the supported dice notation grammar, are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/ssoloff/dice-server-js/wiki/Client-help).

DSJS also provides an [API](https://github.com/ssoloff/dice-server-js/wiki/API) that can be used by third parties to implement a secure dice rolling service between game masters and players.
